# This is a tag-based movie recommendation system
This project has been coded in python (JUPYTER NOTEBOOK) and has been made using natural language processing (machine learning).
The results of this project are static, i.e. don't change on the basis of user input or feedback as it is using the tags of any movie rather than it's reviews.

[Here's a webapp deployed using streamlit for this model](https://hardik-jain-movie-recommendation-system.streamlit.app/)
